**I am a Back-end developer with real-world experience building microservices using Golang, Java (spring boot).  Iâ€™m familiarized with each stage of the software life-cycle and I have a proven track record of building complex backend services and APIs (Rest, Graphql, Grpc) and writing automated unit tests. I also have been working with relational databases like PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases like MongoDB.**
